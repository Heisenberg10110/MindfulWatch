# MindfulWatch
MindfulWatch is an innovative tool designed to help students break free from unnecessary constraints, learn what truly matters, and enjoy life by automating the process of viewing psychological videos. 

The included executable (.exe) is the original version of the tool. If you’d like extra features or have other requests, feel free to reach me on QQ: 248241718. 😊👍

Thank you for your star—it truly means a lot to me! 🌟✨
